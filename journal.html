    <h3>Day 1: 1/13/2024</h3>
    <p>
        Today I wrote and hosted my webpage. I learned a lot about FTP clients such as
        FileZilla and how to use them to upload files to a server. I also learned about
        HTML and how to create a webpage using it. So far it has been a lot of fun and
        I'm excited to learn more about web development and improve on this website
        in the future.
